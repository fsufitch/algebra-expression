# Algebraic expression parser/evaluator

I was bored, so I made this little thing.

Install it with `go get github.com/fsufitch/algebra-expression/cmd/calculate-expression`.
Or, if you're boring, download it from the [releases](https://github.com/fsufitch/algebra-expression/releases) page.

Run with `./calculate-expression.exe` or `./calculate-expression`, depending on your platform.

Nerd.
